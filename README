USAGE:
lua ircbot.lua irc.NETWORK-NAME-HERE.org BOTNICK channel

NOTE that there is NO "#" symbol preceding the channel name.
This is because "#" would need to be escaped in the shell,
eg "\#", making an ugly command line interface.

TODO:
 - Allow dynamic cli args, eg "--network, --channel" etc
 - Continued implementation of useful network functions
